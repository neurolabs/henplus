<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Know this ? You need a small little tool for your everyday work and
you wonder why nobody did this before -- and then you write it yourself.
HenPlus is the result of such an effort. Its name reflects the original 
intent: it started as a platform independent replacement for the 
Oracle SQLPlus tool. 
</p>
<p>
I wrote the first version of HenPlus in 1997 (before
Oracle was available for Linux) since I had to develop an application that 
connected to an Oracle database, but I had no Solaris machine
at home -- and the only SQLPlus I could use back then was running on some 
Redmond operating system that lacked (and still lacks) the 
environment to seriously develop software.
</p>
<p>
Since then I've rewritten
this tool, added command line completion and history -- but it still
remained small and useful. It is freely distributable in source 
and binary form because it is protected by the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU Public License</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="overview"/>Overview</h3>
HenPlus is a SQL shell written in Java that works for any database 
that offers JDBC support. So
basically any database. Why do we need this ? Any database comes with some
shell, but all of them have missing features (and several shells are simply 
unusable).
And if you work with several
databases at once (if you are a developer, then you do this all the time),
switching between these tools is tedious.
<p>
This is where <em>HenPlus</em> steps in. It supports:
<ul>
 <li>Any JDBC aware database.</li>
 <li>Has context sensitive command line completion for commands 
     and tables / columns / variables within SQL-commands. </li>
 <li>Multiple open connection-sessions can be handled in parallel. You can just
     switch between them. So you can be connected to different databases to
     experiment with the same statement in all of them, for example.<br>
     All JDBC-Urls of opened sessions are stored for
     later command line completion in the <code>connect</code> command.</li>
 <li>Command line history just like in the bash (with cursor-up/down, CTRL-R, 
     ...)
     </li>
 <li>A <code>describe</code> command for database tables, that work all
     JDBC-Drivers that unveil the appropriate MetaData (Oracle, PostgreSQL,
     MySQL, DB2...)</li>
 <li>supports variables that are expanded like shell variables
     with $VARIABLENAME or ${VARIABLENAME} (with completion of their names,
     just like in bash)</li>
 <li>loading files</li>
 <li>supports several built-in commands (<code>start</code>, <code>@</code>,
     <code>@@</code>, <code>spool</code>) and
     syntax from the Oracle SQL-plus utility (like the single '/' on a line
     to close a statement). Most Oracle SQL-plus scripts will run directly, so
     its simple to switch to HenPlus. Except if you can't stand, that your
     life will become much simpler, then ;-) If you have problems
     running your old scripts, please let 
     <a href="mailto:H.Zeller@acm.org">me</a> know.</li>
 <li>allows a per-project storage of the commandline history, 
     variables, plugins and connections.
 <li>allows to add your own plugins that behave just like the built-in 
     commands.</li>
 <li>Is provided as Free Software. You are free to modify, copy, share and sell this software under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU Public License</a>

<h3><a name="getting-started"/>Getting started</h3>
<h4>Download</h4>
You can download source and binary packages of HenPlus at the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47945">HenPlus SourceForge Download Page</a> at<br/>
<code>http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47945</code>
<p>
As of March 2005, HenPlus is included in some distributions, for example <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>
testing and unstable, <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.
Use the respective package management tool to install HenPlus on these distributions.
</p>
<p>
For an installation on <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> for Mac have a look at <a href="http://blog.wannawork.de/index.php/2005/09/18/henplus_on_mac_os_using_fink">Bodo Tasche's blog</a>.
If you have a hard time to get the java-readline compiled on Mac OS X, then you might want to check out <a href="http://toonetown.blogspot.com/2006/07/java-readline-on-mac-os-x-update.html">Nathan Toone's blog</a> for an installation description.
</p>

<h4>Compilation</h4>
If you have <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47945">downloaded</a>
HenPlus as a binary RPM or debian package, you can
<a href="#running">skip</a> this part.
<p>
Ok, you are still here, so you have to compile it first. First you need
an additional library.
HenPlus uses the features of the GNU-readline library and therefore
needs the JNI java wrapper library &gt;=
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48669">java-readline 0.7.3</a>.
( <a href="http://toonetown.blogspot.com/2006/07/java-readline-on-mac-os-x-update.html">compilation on Mac OS X</a> )
</p>
<p>
To build HenPlus the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">ant build
tool</a> (Version >= 1.4) is required. To compile HenPlus, make sure that the 
<code>libreadline-java.jar</code> is in the classpath (RedHat and Debian installs the 
java-readline package in <code>/usr/share/java/libreadline-java.jar</code>).
Compilation needs to be done with JDK >= 1.3, but the resulting 
jar file works with old JDK 1.2.2 (the Runtime.addShutdownHook() method is
used in compilation).
</p>
<p>Now, just type
<pre>
$ ant jar
</pre>
If you are root, then you can install it with:
<pre>
# ant install
</pre>
which will install henplus in
<table bgcolor="#DDDDFF" border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
   <td>/usr/share/henplus/henplus.jar</td><td>The jar-file containing
                         the HenPlus classes. You can add additional
			 jar files in this directory. All of them are
			 added to the classpath in the henplus shellscript
			 (use this for JDBC-drivers).
			 </td>
<tr><td>/usr/bin/henplus</td><td>shellscript to start henplus</td></tr>
</table>
If you want another installation base (default: /usr), you 
provide this with the parameter <code>'prefix'</code>:
<pre>
$ ant -Dprefix=/usr/local install
</pre>
<font size="-1">(For package providers: the build.xml provides as well
the <code>DESTDIR</code> parameter with a similar meaning as in usual
Makefiles)</font>
If you've created packages for other operating systems (like
Solaris) or Windows, please <a href="mailto:H.Zeller@acm.org">let me know</a>.
</p>
<p>
I haven't compiled this on Windows, but it shouldn't be a big deal .. if you manage to compile
the java-readline. This is an JNI shared library and thus platform dependant.
If you did it, please post your experience, so that we
can include it in this documentation.

<h4><a name="running"/>Running</h4>
You can start HenPlus with the <code>henplus</code> shell script
with or without an jdbc-url on the command line.
<pre>
$ henplus jdbc:mysql://localhost/foobar
</pre>

</p>
<p>
<h5>Make sure, command line editing is enabled</h5>
If the first line, henplus writes reads:
<pre>
no readline found (no JavaReadline in java.library.path). Using simple stdin.
</pre>
.. then, the JNI-part of the readline library could not be found, so command line
editing is disabled because henplus then reads from stdin as fallback.
This happens if the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> does not point to the JNI library; edit the
<code>/usr/bin/henplus</code> shellscript so that the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> contains the
directory where <code>libJavaReadline.so</code> resides.

<h5>Getting started</h5>
The important commands you need to know to get it running are <code>help</code> and
<code>connect</code>. The help command gives an overview, what commands
are supported:
<hr>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; help
 help | ?                                 : provides help for commands

<a name="config-dir"/><a href="#per-project-config">config read from [/home/hzeller/.henplus]</a>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<hr>
</p>
<p>
You exit the HenPlus shell by typing the <code>exit</code> or <code>quit</code>
command or by just typing EOF-Character (CTRL-D).
</p>
<p>
For almost all commands, there is more detailed help available. You can
just explore the commands by typing <code>help [commandname]</code> and
learn what the built-in commands are all about; all help entries have
a synopsis and a more detailed description like in the following example:

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; help system
<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        system &lt;system-shell-commandline&gt;

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
        Execute a system command in the shell. You can only invoke
        commands,  that do  not expect  anything  from  stdin: the
        interactive  input  from HenPlus  is disconnected from the
        subprocess' stdin. But this is useful to call some small
        commands in the middle of the session. There are two syntaxes
        supported: system &lt;command&gt; or even shorter with the
        exclamation mark: !&lt;command&gt;.
        Example:
        !ls
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>But for now, we are interested how to get connected, so start with the 
<code>connect</code> command
<pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; help connect
</pre>
(more details on connection to the database in the 
<a href="#getting-connected">Getting connected</a> section).
</p>


<h3><a name="getting-connected"/>Getting connected</h3>
Getting connected to a database is simple: you need the JDBC driver
from your database vendor, put it in the classpath, register the driver
-- that&apos;s it. HenPlus provides the commands <code>register</code>, 
<code>unregister</code> and <code>list-drivers</code> to manage the drivers 
(you know it already: the <code>help</code>command tells you more details).

<h4>1. Put the JDBC-Driver in the CLASSPATH</h4>
<a name="put-classpath"/>
<p>
The JDBC-Driver must be in the classpath to be used by HenPlus. Therefore, you
can either add it to the Classpath manually:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
$ CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/my/driver.jar
$ export CLASSPATH
$ henplus
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
The simplest way, however, is to put the jar file with the driver in the
<code>/usr/share/henplus</code> directory:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
# cp /path/to/my/driver.jar /usr/share/henplus
$ henplus
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Since you need to be root to copy the jar-file to that directory, it is
as well possible to add the driver to the <code>.henplus/lib</code> directory
in your home-directory
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.henplus/lib
$ cp /path/to/my/driver.jar ~/.henplus/lib
</pre></td></tr></table>
If you use different <code>.henplus</code> directories for the
<a href="#per-project-config">per project configuration</a>, you need to put the
driver in that directory.
</p>

<h4>2. Register the driver</h4>
<p>
By registering the driver, you allow HenPlus to associate the JDBC-Urls
with the appropriate JDBC-Drivers.
</p>
Some of the common drivers are already registered by default. To see, what drivers
are registered and which of them are actually found in the CLASSPATH, use the
<code>list-drivers</code> command.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; list-drivers
loaded drivers are marked with '*' (otherwise not found in CLASSPATH)
------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    <b>for</b>     |          <b>driver class</b>           |              <b>sample url</b>               |
------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
   Adabas   | de.sag.jdbc.adabasd.ADriver     | jdbc:adabasd://localhost:7200/work    |
   DB2      | COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.net.DB2Driver  | jdbc:db2://localhost:6789/foobar      |
 * MySQL    | org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver         | jdbc:mysql://localhost/foobar         |
 * Oracle   | oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver | jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL |
 * Postgres | org.postgresql.Driver           | jdbc:postgresql://localhost/foobar    |
   SAP-DB   | com.sap.dbtech.jdbc.DriverSapDB | jdbc:sapdb://localhost/foobar         |
------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
With the <code>list-drivers</code>
command you can see what driver classes are registered and loaded. If you
cannot connect to some JDBC URL, check first, if the appropriate driver is
actually loaded. If it is not loaded, then it is probably not found in the
CLASSPATH (see <a href="#put-classpath">Put the JDBC-Driver in the CLASSPATH</a>).
</p>
<p>
Drivers once registered are remembered by HenPlus, so that they are loaded
automatically on next startup. For registering and unregistering drivers,
see the online help:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; help register
Hen*Plus&gt; help unregister
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<h4>3. Connect</h4>
<p>
<a name="connect"/>
When the driver is loaded, you can connect to the database using the
JDBC-URL:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL
HenPlus II connecting
 url 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL'
 driver version 1.0
============ authorization required ===
Username: henman
Password: 
 Oracle - Oracle8i Enterprise Edition Release 8.1.7.0.1 - Production
JServer Release 8.1.7.0.1 - Production
 read committed *
 serializable
henman@oracle:localhost&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
This will then ask for the username and the password and you are
connected.
Since it is not possible to set the terminal to non-echo mode while
typing the password, a thread constantly redraws the prompt (This 
is after a hack
<a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2002/09/pword_mask.html">found here</a>; 
thanks so Alec Noronha for the link.
If the the redrawing causes trouble with your installation, please
let <a href="mailto:H.Zeller@acm.org">me</a> know).
</p>
<p>
Note, that many JDBC-Drivers allow for a URL-syntax, that already
includes the name and the password; in that case, you can connect
directly without typing the user/password; for example in Oracle:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:<b>foo/bar</b>@localhost:1521:BLUE
HenPlus II connecting
 url 'jdbc:oracle:thin:foo/bar@localhost:1521:BLUE'
 driver version 1.0
 Oracle - Oracle9i Enterprise Edition Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production
With the Partitioning option
JServer Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production
 read committed *
 serializable
FOO@oracle:localhost&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Typing JDBC-URLs is tedious ? That&apos;s right, so HenPlus remembers all the
connection URLs you were connected to and provides it in the context
sensitive commandline completion for the connect command. So next time you
connect, you just type
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; connect <b><font color="#3333FF">&lt;TAB&gt;</font></b>
jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL  jdbc:oracle:thin:@database.my.net:1521:BLUE
Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@<b><font color="#3333FF">d&lt;TAB&gt;</font></b>
Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@database.my.net:1521:BLUE
</pre></td></tr></table>
.. and connecting with long URLs is a piece of cake.
</p>
<p>
<b>Define an easy to remember alias for a connection</b> On connect, you
can provide a short name for that session as second parameter after the
JDBC-URL:
<pre>
  Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@database.my.net:1521:BLUE <b>myora</b>
   [.. connect to jdbc:oracle:thin:@database.my.net:1521:BLUE ..]
  myora&gt;
</pre>
This will do two things: first the session name will be renamed after
this alias and this name can be used as a shortcut for later connections:
<pre>
  Hen*Plus&gt; connect <b>myora</b>
   [.. connect to jdbc:oracle:thin:@database.my.net:1521:BLUE ..]
  myora&gt;
</pre>
</p>
On connection, the prompt changes to a string that reflects the current 
connection. By
default, this prompt is automatically extracted from the JDBC-URL, but you
can provide another name as second parameter in the connection command (see
help for the 'connect' command). Or just rename the session:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; rename-session hello
hello&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
You can disconnect with the <code>disconnect</code> command or by
simply pressing CTRL-D.
</p>

<h3>Special Characters in the Shell</h3>
<h4>Command Separators</h4>
Usually there is one command per line. However, you can have multiple
commands on one line if you separate them with a semicolon:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
echo "*** The build-in help ***" ; help
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The SQL commands however (you guess it: 'select', 'update', 'create' .. ) are
not complete after the newline; you <em>always</em> have to close them
with a semicolon -- so it is possible to write statements on multiple lines:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
oracle:localhost&gt; create table foobar (
                    id number(10) primary key,
                    text varchar(127)
                  );
ok. (70 msec)
oracle:localhost&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Some commands are not even complete, if there is a semicolon -- these are
'create procedure' and 'create trigger'. These commands contain 
some more complex SQL-operations that are each separated by a semicolon. 
The whole
command is then completed with a single slash at the beginning of a new line 
(this syntax is the same that SQLPlus supports):

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
oracle:localhost&gt; create or replace trigger foobar_autoinc
                  before insert on foobar
                  for each row
                  begin
                    select foobar_seq.nextval into :new.id from dual;
                  end foobar_autoinc;
                  /
ok. (320 msec)
oracle:localhost&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
(The current keywords that trigger requiering the '/' as command separator are
 "CREATE" followed by PROCEDURE, TRIGGER, FUNCTION or PACKAGE later. If this
 is not enough, please let me know).
</p>

<h4>SQL-Comments</h4>
That should be enough to start working with HenPlus. But especially if you are
running scripts (with the <code>load</code>-command)
there is one additional piece of information you might
need to know: the types of comments that are ignored. AFAIK, the
SQL standard defines only an ANSI-endline comment, that starts with two dashes;
this is supported by HenPlus:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
  select * from foobar; -- this is a comment
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
However, other non-standard types of comments have come to use in
several SQL-shells so HenPlus ignores these as well. One style are
the C/C++/Java style comments, that comment out a range between 
<code>/*&nbsp;some&nbsp;comment&nbsp;*/</code>.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
/*
   This is a longer comment that goes
   across several lines
 */
 select * from foobar;
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Another style of comments, allowed for instance in the 
MySQL-Shell is the UNIX-shell like '#' endline comment; however, this character
is <b>only</b> allowed as first character of a line to be a comment -- otherwise
using the Hash-Symbol in normal SQL-Statements (e.g. column names), would not work.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
# this is a comment.
 select * from foobar;
 create table foo (id# number); -- the hash here does not start a comment
</pre></td></tr></table>

One beta tester <!-- Andi G. --> requested an additional type of 
comment: Two semicolons at 
<em>the beginning</em> of a line to comment out the whole line. The problem
with semicolon is, that it is as well used as separator between commands and
as such may of course occur twice in a row. Therefore, two 
semicolons are <em>only</em> regarded as comment, if they are the
first on a line:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
;; This line is commented out
   ;; this one as well, since there are only whitespaces on the left
select * from foobar ;; echo "this echo is executed as usual"
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
To make a long story short -- the supported types of comments are
<ul>
  <li>Ansi-Style <b><code>--</code></b> (two dashes) comment until end of line</li>
  <li>UNIX-Shell Style <b><code>#</code></b> comment until end of line</li>
  <li>Lisp-like <b><code>;;</code></b> comment until end of line</li>
  <li>C/C++/Java like <b><code>/*&nbsp;range&nbsp;comment&nbsp;*/</code></b>
</ul>
<em>Not</em> supported is the C++/Java like endline comment that starts with
two slashes <b><code>//</code></b>. The reason is, that many JDBC-URLs contain
these two slashes, and we don't want to comment these out, right ? ;-)
</p>
<p>
If you encounter some other reasonable style of comments you want that it is
supported by HenPlus, please let <a href="mailto:H.Zeller@acm.org">me</a> know.
</p>
<p>
<b>Switching off comment removal...</b><a name="remove-comment"/>
Usually, all comments are removed in HenPlus before sending commands to the
database, because many JDBC-drivers or databases cannot handle comments
sufficiently.
However, sometimes it is necessary <em>not</em> to remove comments, since some
databases use comments to convey hinting in statements. In Oracle, for instance,
you give hints to the query optimizer in the form
<pre>
    select <b>/*+ index(foo,foo_a_idx) */</b> a from foo where ...
</pre>
For this reason, it is possible to switch off automatic comment removal.
This is the global HenPlus <a href="#properties">property</a> 
<code>comments-remove</code>; it allows to switch off comment 
removal, so strings are sent to the database as-is. The command is 
<pre>

<h3><a name="multiple-open-sessions"/>Multiple Open Sessions</h3>
You can be connected to multiple databases at once; just issue the <code>connect</code>
command multiple times. You can list the sessions you are connected to
the <code>sessions</code> command.
Of course, the shell provides only access to one
session at a time so you can switch between the sessions with the 'switch' command.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL
<i>[... enter user/password ...]</i>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
mysql:localhost&gt; sessions
current session is marked with '*'
------------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
           <b>session</b>            |  <b>user</b>  |                 <b>url</b>                   |
------------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
    henman@oracle:localhost   | henman | jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:ORCL |
  * mysql:localhost           | [NULL] | jdbc:mysql://localhost/test           |
------------------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
mysql:localhost&gt; switch henman@oracle:localhost
henman@oracle:localhost&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
Of course, the switch command provides command line completion for the other
sessions names. If you only have two sessions, then its even easier: just
type <code>switch</code> without parameter (so in the example above, this would
have been sufficient).

<h3><a name="variables"/>Using Variables</h3>
<h4>Manual use of Variables</h4>
You can use Variables, that can be used as text replacement everywhere. The
replacement works similar to shellscripts, however setting must be done
explicitly with the <code>set</code> command instead of a simple assignment:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; set-var tabname footab
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; select count(*) from ${tabname};
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p><b><!-- remove this note in later versions again -->
NOTE: The command for setting variables has changed since Version 0.9 of HenPlus.
Previously, this command was 'set'; it changed to 'set-var', since several
Databases understand 'set' as a build in-command that otherwise would be
shadowed by HenPlus' set.
</b></p>
<p>
Setting variables with values that span multiple lines have to be embraced by 
single or double-quotes; in
the next example we use a variable to define storage options once and reuse
it for multiple tables in Oracle (note the quotes):
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; set-var STORAGE_OPTIONS  <b>"</b>pctused 40 pctfree 10
         storage ( initial 512k NEXT 1024k PCTINCREASE 0
                   MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS UNLIMITED )
         TABLESPACE users<b>"</b>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; create table foo (id number(10), text varchar2(1024)) ${STORAGE_OPTIONS};
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; create table bar (id number(10), description varchar2(1024)) ${STORAGE_OPTIONS};
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Variables can be expanded with or without curly braces: $FOO and ${FOO} is the same.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want a variable to be expanded, double the dollar-sign: <code>$$FOO</code>;
the Unix-shell way to embed it in single-quotes (like '$FOO') does <em>not</em> work.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the shell, variables that are <b>not</b> set, are <b>not</b> expanded to an empty
string, but left as they are. So an unset variable $FOOBAR expands to .. $FOOBAR. This
is, because some databases (especially Oracle in system views) use names with
dollar characters; thus character sequences starting with '$' that cannot be recognized as
HenPlus-variable have to be left as they are.
</p>
<h4>Special Variables</h4>
<p>
<a name="special-variables"/>
Special variables are variables that have a special meaning to 
HenPlus. Currently there is only one special variable, that is set 
automatically.
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>_HENPLUS_LAST_COMMAND</code></td>
    <td>This variable contains the last command executed by HenPlus</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<h4>Showing and Unsetting Variables</h4>
<p>
All variable settings can be shown with the <code>set-var</code> command 
without any parameters. Unsetting variables works with <code>unset-var</code>.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>

</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
All non-special variables that are set at the end of the session are stored, so that they are available on next startup.
</p>

<h3><a name="properties"/>Setting Properties</h3>
There are some global properties, that can be modified by the <code>set-property</code>
command. Connection session specific properties are handled with the 
<code>set-session-property</code> command. Corresponding <code>reset-*</code> commands reset
the property to its default.
<p>The usage of these commands is simple. If you just type the set-* command, then the
list of supported properties with short description is shown. With the property name given as
single parameter, the detailed help for that property is given. With an additional parameter the
property is actually set to that value:

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>

</p>
<p>
Note, that the property names are TAB-completed and even the values,
if they are restricted (like 'on', 'off').
</p>

<h4>1. Global Properties</h4>
<p>
Global properties are stored in your <a href="#per-project-config">project preferences</a>, so
that you don't have to retype them on next startup.

<h4>2. Session Properties</h4>
<p>
For supported properties of the SQL-connection session just type 
<code>set-session-property</code>. At present, the properties <code>auto-commit</code>,
<code>isolation-level</code> and <code>read-only</code> are supported. 
Unlike the global properties, this set of properties is specific per session and is not stored.
</p>
<p>
The values that are possible for the transaction isolation are provided by the
JDBC-driver and are conveniently provided by the TAB-completion:

<h3><a name="commandline-completion"/>Commandline Editing/Completion</h3>
<p>
HenPlus provides the common amenities for command line editing and history 
(cursor-up/down, CTRL-R) that are already known from bash
(See the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/bashman/bashref_81.html">Bash Command Line Editing</a>
 documentation for details).
</p>
In addition to that, HenPlus provides TAB-completion for virtually everything that can be
completed according to the context: tables in
select statements, column-names in where-clauses, variable-names in set-var/unset-var command,
variable names after typing '<code>$</code>' or <code>'${'</code>, Function Key Names
in the bind-key-cmd command, property names and its values ..<br/>
Just try it ..

<h3><a name="per-project-config"/>Per Project Configuration</h3>
<em>HenPlus</em> stores almost any settings like the commandline
history, the connection-URLs, variable settings, parameters, aliases,
key bindings etc. in files in a directory in the filesystem.
This directory is by default located in your home directory and
called <code>~/.henplus</code>.
Whenever you start henplus, this configuration directory is used by
default.
<p>
If you have multiple projects you work on, the settings of all
these projects would collected in the <code>~/.henplus</code> directory, thus
your command history would fill up with commands not needed in that 
project or you need switch settings all the time.
So if you work in multiple projects with specific connect strings, 
variables, properties etc. a per project separation of this information is
desirable.
<em>HenPlus</em> supports per project storage of this information.
</p>
<p>
To store only information you use in some project, just create an empty 
<code>.henplus</code> directory in the directory you usually start the
<em>HenPlus</em> utility -- then <em>HenPlus</em> will use this directory to
store its configuration. More, if it does not find the <code>.henplus</code>
directory within the current working dir, it goes up the directory tree
until it finds the <code>.henplus</code> directory. If it still does
not find the directory, it falls back to the <code>~/.henplus</code> in your
home directory.
</p>
<p>
As an example consider these directories:
<pre>
  /home/hzeller/.henplus/
  /home/hzeller/projects/project-a/.henplus/
  /home/hzeller/projects/project-b/.henplus/
</pre>
Starting <em>HenPlus</em> in any directory below
<code>/home/hzeller/projects/project-a/</code> will use 
the <code>/home/hzeller/projects/project-a/.henplus/</code>
configuration directory, same for any directory below 
<code>/home/hzeller/projects/project-b/</code>
for instance 
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
$ cd /home/hzeller/projects/project-b/src/henplus/commands
$ henplus
using GNU readline (Brian Fox, Chet Ramey), Java wrapper by Bernhard Bablok
henplus config at <b>/home/hzeller/projects/project-b/.henplus</b>
 [...]
</pre></td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
Starting henplus anywhere else will use the configuration in the
home directory in <code>/home/hzeller/</code>
</p>
<p>
If you type 'help', then <em>HenPlus</em> tells you
in the <a href="#config-dir">last line</a>, where it has loaded its initial 
configuration from.
</p>

<h3><a name="plugins"/>Plugins</h3>
Need some command that creates some fancy statistics or report from your
database tables ? Or need a command
that you are missing from some other database tool ? Or want to pop up
some Swing-window to do database record editing <!-- Armin H. --> ?
<p>
HenPlus does not limit you to the features already provided.
It is very simple to write
plug-ins, that can be added and removed at run time. See the help for
<code>plug-in</code>, <code>plug-out</code> and <code>list-plugins</code> for details.
Basically, you just need to write a class that implements 
the <code>henplus.Command</code> interface. A plugin will register one (or a set of)
new commands that behave just like internal commands. They are, for instance,
available in the <code>help</code> command.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is one cool plugin shipped since version 0.9.4, provided by
<a href="mailto:martin.grotzke@javakaffee.de">Martin Grotzke</a>. It resides in the
henplus.jar, so if you have installed henplus, it is already there, but you have
to plug-in this command yourself; after plugging it in, HenPlus will 
<a href="#per-project-config">remember</a> this for future starts.

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
Hen*Plus&gt; plug-in henplus.plugins.tablediff.TableDiffCommand

Hen*Plus&gt; list-plugins

 * henplus.plugins.tablediff.TableDiffCommand | tablediff |
----------------------------------------------+-----------+
</table>
What does this command do ? By providing two session names and a list of tables, 
you get the meta difference for corresponding tables in both sessions. So you
get whether columns have been added/removed or datatypes that are different for columns 
with the same name. This is particularly useful if you have multiple installations of
database schemas and wonder if they match (e.g. for test/productive environments);
a way to automatically create 'alter table'-scripts is planned.
</p><p>

<em>(TODO: This feature needs a way to load the classes from an URLClassloader,
 so its possible to dynamically reload the classes when they changed. Anyone?)</em>
</p>

<h3><a name="aliases"/>Aliases</h3>
For certain repeating tasks its tedious to write the same command over and over again.
Therefore it is possible to store aliases.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; alias ls tables
</pre></td></tr></table>
This would alias the 'tables' command so that it can be called by simply typing
'ls'.
<p>
Parameters given to aliases are appended to the original command, so that you can 
define aliases for commands that need parameters:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; alias size select count(*) from
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; size footab
execute alias: select count(*) from footab
----------+
 <b>count(*)</b> |
----------+
        9 |
----------+
1 row in result (first row: 3 msec; total: 3 msec)
</pre></td></tr></table>
Note, that even TAB-completion (in this case: of the tablename) works: the alias
command peeks into the original command that is executed when you type 'size'.
</p>
<p>
All aliases can be shown with <code>list-aliases</code>; they are stored, so that they
are available on next startup.
</p>
<p>
<em>(TODO: cool would be aliases with parameters, 
like <code>select * from ${0} where ${1}=${2}</code>)</em>
</p>

<h3><a name="keybindings"/>Keybindings</h3>
<p>
In HenPlus it is possible to bind function keys to commands to be executed
(a bit depending on the terminal, but should work on usual Unix terminals).
It is possible to bind an arbitrary string to a function key; the string
is issued whenever the function key is pressed. This can be used as a 
shortcut to excute commands; so instead of pressing help&lt;RETURN&gt; you
could bind the same command to a function key:</p>
<code>
bind-key-cmd F1 "help\n"
</code>
</p>
<p>The function keys F1..F12 and Shift-F1..Shift-F12 are available.
</p>

<h3><a name="cmd-bookmarks"/>Setting Command Bookmarks</h3>
Sometimes it would be nice set a 'bookmark' to a command just executed.
<p>
With the keybinding this is simple to do. Consider, you want to set a
bookmark with Shift-F2 and execute it with F2. So what we want to do on 
Shift-F2 is to bind the command we just executed to F2. With a little quoting
and use of the special variable ${_HENPLUS_LAST_COMMAND} we can do the trick:
</p>
<code>
bind-key-cmd Shift-F2 "bind-key-cmd F2 \"$${_HENPLUS_LAST_COMMAND};\\n\"\n"
</code>
<p>
to bind the last command
executed to F2 (Note the double $$ and the \\ to prevent certain elements
bo be expanded prematurely).
So executing Shift-F2 will now execute the command</p>
<code>
bind-key-cmd F2 "${_HENPLUS_LAST_COMMAND};\n"
</code>
<p>that binds F2 to the command that has been just executed.</p>
<p>
So pressing Shift-F2 sets a bookmark and F2 executes it.
</p>

<h3><a name="table-dumps"/>Database independent table dumps</h3>
You can dump out tables in a database independent format. See the online help for
<code>dump-out</code> and <code>dump-in</code>. You even can dump only selected
values of a certain table; see <code>dump-conditional</code> for this.
<p>
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; dump-out mytables.dump.gz student addresses;
</pre></td></tr></table>
.. dumps out the tables <code>student</code> and <code>addresses</code> to the file
<code>mytables.dump.gz</code>. Note, that the file is gzipped automatically
on-the-fly if the file contains a <code>.gz</code>-suffix.
</p>
<p>
The format that is written must be database independent, thus it is not possible to store
them as simple <code>'INSERT INTO..'</code> statements, as the different databases have different
assumption how some data types should be parsed (esp. dates..) :-( Thus the dump format is a
canonical text format that resembles the original insert-statement arguments; it is easily
parseable for the human eye and external tools; it is sufficiently simply to create
'INSERT INTO'-scripts with simple Shell scripts:
<hr noshade='noshade' size="1" />
<pre>
(tabledump 'student'
   (file-encoding 'UTF-8')
   (dump-version 1 1)
   (henplus-version '0.9.1')
   (database-info 'MySQL - 3.23.47')
   (meta ('name',   'sex',    'student_id')
         ('STRING', 'STRING', 'INTEGER'   ))
   (data ('Megan','F',1)
         ('Joseph','M',2)
         ('Kyle','M',3)
         ('Mac Donald\'s','M',4))
   (rows 4))
</pre>
<hr noshade='noshade' size="1" />
</p>
<p>
Note, not all data types are supported yet: the CLOB and BLOB data type are handled too 
differently even though JDBC should allow access database independently. This will be
included in a future
</p>
<h4>XML ?</h4>
One could argue, that XML would be an idea as export format, since it is hype and
therefore should be used everywhere :-) ... But seriously, I decided against it because it 
blows up the file size (and database exports tend not to be small) and is not 
very human readable due to the 'noise'. 
If you still think, that XML would be a good idea, then consider normal use-cases 
of dumps like this (besides dump-in with HenPlus of course):
<ul>
  <li>Process them with line oriented tools (like <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code> .. or your
      favourite editor)</li>
  <li>Construct insert/update scripts for databases manually.
</ul>
Both use-cases are addressed with this format: each data record is on a single line and is almost
compatible with the typical set-syntax of SQL. You can simply construct an insert-Statement
with this format with only minimal editing required like:
<pre>
 insert&nbsp;into&nbsp;student&nbsp;(name,&nbsp;sex,&nbsp;student_id)&nbsp;values&nbsp;<b>('Joseph','M',2)</b>;
</pre>
</p><p>
Ok, XML would be great for many other tools (as long as 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points#text">humans don't have to deal with it</a>) 
.. but I don't use them. So if you <em>want</em> XML export/import, you are free to do it: just go ahead and 
write a <a href='#plugins'>plugin</a> that does this and let me know for integration.
</p>

<h3><a name="tree-view"/>Tree View of connected tables</h3>
Know this ? To just find out the datastructure of foreign-key connected
tables in your database you have to <code>describe</code> manually through
all tables. This is quite tedious. Thus, HenPlus provides a tree view of
your tables. Cyclic references are resolved by printing the recursive
entity in parenthesis.  See the example for some bugtracker database:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
henman@oracle:localhost&gt; tree-view BT_TRACKERUSER

<b>A: </b>This is primarily not a problem with HenPlus, but in general with
         Postgres when it encounters an error in some SQL-statement. Since
	 everything in Postgres is done within a transaction, a
	 transaction is regarded invalid after some error; any subsequent 
	 commands are
	 ignored, until you finish the transaction with 'commit' or 'rollback'.
	 This might be annoying if you run SQL-scripts -- if there is only
	 one error, all subsequent commands are ignored. One solution
	 might be to switch on autocommit 
	 (HenPlus command: <code>set-session-property auto-commit on</code>).

<b>Q:  </b><em>Is it possible to have henplus use the vi-editing mode rather than
               the default emacs like editing mode ?</em>
<br/>
<b>A:  </b>Create/edit the ~/.inputrc configuration file to influence the behaviour of
           readline. Add a line
	   <table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
           set editing-mode vi</pre></td></tr></table>
           To this file. Then set the environment-variable INPUTRC to point to this
           file:
           <table width="100%" bgcolor="#DDDDFF"><tr><td><pre>
           export INPUTRC=~/.inputrc</pre></td></tr></table>
